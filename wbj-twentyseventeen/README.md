## Base Theme History
This WordPress theme is forked from a bare-bones base theme created by Zach Smith called [tater](https://github.com/zachisit/tater-wordpress-theme), with base theme version number 1.1.3. This theme does not utlilize a parent-child theme structure. The perferred editor is PHPStorm, hence the existing .gitigore rule(s).
